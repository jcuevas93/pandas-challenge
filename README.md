# Pandas Challenge

## Aim of Analysis

The primary goal of this analysis is to extract valuable insights from both the student dataset and the school dataset based on performance in various scenarios. The process begins with merging both datasets and generating new data to measure and refine our questions further.

## Conclusions from Data

1. **Charter Schools Outperform:**
   - Charter schools demonstrate higher overall scores in both math and reading compared to other school types.

2. **Size Matters:**
   - Smaller schools tend to achieve higher overall scores in both math and reading.
   - The analysis suggests a positive correlation between school size and academic performance.
